# SAFE-OPT
Code and data for the paper "SAFE-OPT: A Bayesian optimization algorithm for learning optimal deep brain stimulation parameters with safety constraints"

This directory implements a Bayesian optimization algorithm with learnable safety constraints for the automatic optimization of stimulation parameters.

**Code:** Code for simulating SAFE-OPT, deployment in vivo, and plotting SAFE-OPT results

**Data:** Directory containing raw data sheets with SOR task data/stimulation parameters, and saved/processed modeling results

**Tools:** Algorithm dependencies 

To use: make sure to add whole root repo directory + subfolders to the MATLAB path before running individual scripts
